=======Approach==================
I had go through the design and get how to implement the basic structure and design using Sass(Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets).Using React-router-dom i had done Navbarto navigate the components then i have created individual components for reuseability. after that i focused on how to implement a map using react-simple-map go through the react simple map and design and implement step by step as such possible. After that i thought about how to implement graphs like Bar chart , bubble chart and scatter charts i had read about on how how to implement and apply on my project so i done using ApexChart library,react charts and i implemented the bubble chart using JSX and SASS
